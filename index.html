        A full-time software engineer with a passion for creating scalable,
        testable, and performant applications using the TypeScript and React

        <p>
          In all of my programming projects, I start with a static type system,
          either TypeScript for client-side code or Go for server-side code. A
          weak type system leads to subtle bugs while working in large codebases
          with several developers. We lack the intelligence of compilers. Leave
          the task to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a web application requires complex functionality coupled with a
          template, it is time to use React. Because JavaScript is more
          imperative, codebases become complex using the `Sanitizer` API,
          serializing/deserializing HTML, and returning string templates with
          variables embedded. All of this has been simplified by React.
        </p>
        <p>
          React's declarative API may be used to expedite the entire development
          process and reduce the amount of context a developer must hold in
          their head at any given time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of all the programming languages, Go is probably my favorite. And
          not just because it's a language, but also because it's a whole
          toolchain. Strong standard libraries, several documents outlining its
          detailed usage, built-in unit testing with coverage and fuzzing,
          static typing, code-formatting, etc. are all included with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming from the disjointed JavaScript ecosystem. Go makes the
          development process more enjoyable. I don't have to resort to a
          third-party dependency or waste time configuring build tools. Most of
          the time, it just works. I'm devoting less time to debugging and more
          to development.
